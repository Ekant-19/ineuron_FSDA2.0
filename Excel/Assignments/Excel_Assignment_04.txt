1. To use the ribbon commands, what menu and grouping of commands will you
   find the Insert and Delete command?
   In Excel, the "Insert" and "Delete" commands can be found in the "Cells" group within the "Home" tab of the Ribbon menu.

   Here's how to locate them:

   - Open Microsoft Excel and navigate to the worksheet where we want to use the "Insert" and "Delete" commands.
   - Look for the "Home" tab in the Excel Ribbon. The Ribbon is the horizontal bar at the top of the Excel window, and it contains several tabs
     with different groups of commands.
   - Click on the "Home" tab to activate it.
   - Within the "Home" tab, we will see several groups of commands. Look for the "Cells" group, which is typically located on the far right side 
     of the "Home" tab.
   - In the "Cells" group, we will find the "Insert" and "Delete" commands represented by icons. The "Insert" command usually appears as an
     icon with a down arrow above a horizontal line, while the "Delete" command appears as an icon with an "X" symbol.


2. If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and column?
   If we set a row height or column width to 0 (zero) in Microsoft Excel, the row or column will effectively be hidden from view. However,
   it's essential to note that the row or column is not deleted or removed from the worksheet; it is simply not visible on the screen.


3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?
   Yes, there are situations where we may need to change the height and width of cells in Microsoft Excel. Here are some reasons why adjusting 
   cell height and width can be necessary:
    - Fit Text or Contents: If the content in a cell exceeds the default cell size, adjusting the height and width allows us to fit the entire text 
      or contents within the cell, making it fully visible without truncation.
    - Readability and Formatting: Changing the height and width of cells can enhance the readability of our data by allowing us to adjust the size 
      of cells to match the content. Properly formatted cells can make our spreadsheet more visually appealing and organized.
    - Merge Cells: In certain cases, we might want to merge cells to create a single, larger cell that spans multiple rows or columns. 
      This is helpful for creating headings, titles, or labels that cover a broader area.
    - Printing: When we need to print our Excel worksheet, resizing the cells can ensure that the printed version looks neat and aligned. 
      Adjusting the cell size can help fit the data appropriately on the printed page.
    - Formatting for Specific Data: Customizing the cell height and width can be useful when dealing with specific data types, such as images or 
      long URLs, which require more space in the cell.
    - Data Entry: For data entry purposes, we might want to enlarge the cells to make it easier to enter data or view data while typing.

4. What is the keyboard shortcut to unhide rows?
   For unhide the rows we can use "Ctrl+Shift+9"


5. How to hide rows containing blank cells?
   To hide rows containing blank cells in Microsoft Excel without using the AutoFilter feature, we can use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro.
   This macro will scan through the selected range and hide any rows that have at least one blank cell.


6. What are the steps to hide the duplicate values using conditional formatting in
   excel?
   To hide duplicate values in Excel using conditional formatting, we can follow these steps:

   Step 1: Select the Range
   Select the range of cells where we want to hide the duplicate values. Make sure the active cell is within the range we want to apply the 
   conditional formatting to.
   Step 2: Open Conditional Formatting
   Go to the "Home" tab on the Excel Ribbon and click on "Conditional Formatting" in the "Styles" group. In the dropdown menu,
   select "Highlight Cells Rules," and then choose "Duplicate Values."
   Step 3: Choose Formatting Style
   A dialog box will appear, showing the available formatting options for the duplicate values. 
   By default, Excel will highlight the duplicate values with a light red fill color. You can choose a different format if prefer.
