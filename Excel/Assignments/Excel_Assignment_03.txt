1. How and when to use the AutoSum command in excel?
   The AutoSum command in Excel is a quick and convenient way to automatically insert common mathematical functions (such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.) 
   for a selected range of cells. It helps us to perform basic calculations without manually typing the formulas, reducing the chances of errors and saving time.  
   The AutoSum feature is particularly useful when we want to perform simple calculations on numerical data quickly.
   
   Here's how to use the AutoSum command:

   - Select the cell where we want the result of the calculation to appear. For example, if we want the sum of a range,  
     select the cell below the range or to the right of it.
   - Click on the "AutoSum" button in the "Editing" group on the "Home" tab of the Excel ribbon. The AutoSum button looks like the Greek letter Sigma (âˆ‘).
   - Excel will automatically try to detect the range of cells we want to include in the calculation. The range will be highlighted with a marquee border.
     If Excel selects the correct range, press "Enter" to confirm the calculation. If it doesn't, we can adjust the range manually by dragging the selection or typing the correct range.
   - The AutoSum command will insert the appropriate function (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.) along with the selected range in the formula bar,
     and it will display the calculated result in the selected cell.

   When to use the AutoSum command:

   - Adding a series of numbers: Use AutoSum when we want to find the sum of a range of numbers quickly.
   - Calculating averages: AutoSum is handy for finding the average of a range of values without writing the AVERAGE formula manually.
   - Counting cells with values: When we need to count the number of cells with numerical values, we can use AutoSum with the COUNT function.
   - Min and Max calculations: AutoSum can help us to quickly find the minimum and maximum values in a range using the MIN and MAX functions.


2. What is the shortcut key to perform AutoSum?
   In Excel the shortcut key to perform AutoSum is "Alt + =".
   


3. How do you get rid of Formula that omits adjacent cells?
   - Select the cell containing the formula: Click on the cell that contains the formula we want to remove.
   - Copy the value: Press "Ctrl + C" on keyboard or right-click on the cell and choose "Copy" from the context menu. 
     This will copy the cell's value, which is the result of the formula.
   - Paste the value as a "Paste Special" operation: Right-click on the same cell, choose "Paste Special" from the context menu,
     and then select "Values" from the options. Alternatively, we can use the keyboard shortcut "Alt + E + S + V" to perform the same operation.
   - The formula will be replaced by its calculated value, and the cell will no longer contain the formula but only the final result.



4. How do you select non-adjacent cells in Excel 2016?
   - Click on the first cell we want to select.
   - Press and hold the "Ctrl" key on keyboard.
   - While holding the "Ctrl" key, use mouse to click on other cells we want to select. Each cell we click will be added to the selection.
   - Release the "Ctrl" key when we have selected all the non-adjacent cells we need.


5. What happens if you choose a column, hold down the Alt key and press the letters
   ocw in quick succession?
   Pressing Alt + o + c + w in quick succession will open the "Format Cells" dialog box and take us directly to the "Wrap Text" option under the "Alignment" tab. 
   This allows us to quickly enable or disable text wrapping for the selected cells in the chosen column without using the mouse to navigate through the Ribbon menu.


6. If you right-click on a row reference number and click on Insert, where will the row
   be added?
   If we right-click on a row reference number in Microsoft Excel and click on "Insert," a new row will be added directly above the 
   row that corresponds to the row reference number we clicked on.
