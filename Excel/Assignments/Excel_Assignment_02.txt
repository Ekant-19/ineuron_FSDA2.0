1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
   The dollar sign ($) has a special function when used in cell references. It is used to create an absolute reference,
   which means that the cell reference will not change when copied or moved to other cells. 
   This is particularly useful when we want to fix a reference to a specific cell or range, ensuring that it remains constant regardless of where it is used.



2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed).
   In Excel, we can change cell references from relative to absolute or mixed by using the dollar sign ($) appropriately. 
   Changing a Reference to Absolute:
   To change a cell reference to an absolute reference (both column and row fixed), we need to add dollar signs before the column letter and row number. For example:
   Relative Reference: A1
   Absolute Reference: $A$1


3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
   In Microsoft Excel, the order of operations refers to the sequence in which mathematical and logical operations are performed in a formula. 
   Just like in mathematics, Excel follows a specific set of rules to calculate the results of complex formulas correctly. The order of operations in Excel is as follows:
   Parentheses (Brackets) 
   Exponents 
   Multiplication and Division - Excel performs multiplication and division operations from left to right. Both these operations have the same precedence.
   Addition and Subtraction -  Excel performs addition and subtraction operations from left to right. Both these operations have the same precedence.


4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
   The top 5 functions in Microsoft Excel, based on their versatility and usefulness, are:

   SUM: Adds up the values in a range of cells.
   Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)
   Example: =SUM(A1:A5) - This will sum the values in cells A1 to A5.

   VLOOKUP: Searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.
   Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
   Example: =VLOOKUP(B2, A1:C10, 3, FALSE) - This will look for the value in cell B2 within the range A1:C10 and return the value in the third column of the matched row.

   IF: Evaluates a condition and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if it's false.
   Syntax: =IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)  
   Example: =IF(A1>10, "Greater than 10", "Less than or equal to 10") - This will check if the value in cell A1 is greater than 10 and return different messages accordingly.

   COUNT: Counts the number of cells in a range that contains numeric values.
   Syntax: =COUNT(value1, [value2], ...)
   Example: =COUNT(A1:A10) - This will count the number of cells in the range A1:A10 that contain numeric values.

   CONCATENATE: Joins multiple text strings into one.
   Syntax: =CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)
   Example: =CONCATENATE("Hello", " ", "World") - This will concatenate the three strings into "Hello World".


5. When would you use the subtotal function?
   The SUBTOTAL function in Excel is used to perform calculations on a range of data while providing the flexibility to ignore other SUBTOTAL functions within the range. 
   It is particularly useful when we want to apply different aggregate functions to a dataset that contains subtotals or nested subtotals. 
   The SUBTOTAL function is often used in combination with filtered or sorted data.

   The general syntax of the SUBTOTAL function is as follows:
   SUBTOTAL(function_num, range1, [range2], ...)
   function_num: An integer representing the function to be used for calculation (e.g., 1 for AVERAGE, 9 for SUM, 2 for COUNT, etc.). 
   Excel offers various function numbers that correspond to different aggregate functions.
   range1, [range2], ...: The range(s) of cells we want to perform the calculation on.  





6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
   The VLOOKUP function in Excel is used to search for a value in the first column of a table (or range) and retrieve a corresponding value from a specified column 
   within the same row. It is commonly used for performing table lookups and is especially helpful for large datasets where we need to find specific information quickly.

   The syntax of the VLOOKUP function is as follows:
   VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
   Let's break down each term in the syntax:

   lookup_value: This is the value we want to find in the first column of the table. It is the value we are looking for in the lookup process. 
   The lookup_value can be a constant, a cell reference, or a formula that evaluates to a value we want to search for.

   table_array: This is the range of cells that contains the data we want to search. It is the table from which we want to look up the value. 
   The table_array should include the column that contains the lookup_value and the column from which we want to retrieve the result.

   col_index_num: This is the column number from which we want to retrieve the result value. It represents the relative position of the column in the table_array.
   The first column in the table_array is column number 1, the second column is column number 2, and so on.

   range_lookup: This is an optional argument that specifies whether we want an exact match or an approximate match. 
   If we omit this argument or set it to TRUE (or 1), the VLOOKUP function will perform an approximate match and look for the closest match to the lookup_value 
   in the first column. If we set it to FALSE (or 0), the function will perform an exact match and only return a result if it finds an exact match to the lookup_value.

   It's important to note that when using VLOOKUP, the first column in the table_array must contain the lookup values in 
   ascending order for an approximate match to work correctly. For an exact match, the order does not matter.
